# HTML & CSS Mini Projects

A collection of small, hands-on front-end projects built using pure HTML and CSS.
Each project focuses on a specific UI component or layout pattern to improve
practical front-end skills through consistent practice.

New projects are added gradually as they are finished.

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository documents my front-end practice and steady improvement.
The goal is to build a strong foundation in HTML and CSS by creating real,
visual components rather than full websites.

Projects are committed regularly as part of an ongoing learning process.
